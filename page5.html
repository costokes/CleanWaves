        <p>I moved to Myrtle Beach 6 years ago and I fortanetly live directly on the beach. I spend most of my free time walking the beach and swimming when it is warm enough. In all the time I have lived in Myrtle Beach I have seen a decline is cleanliness from tourism at my local avenue and other surrounding areas. I took it upon myself to start picking up waste and looking into effective ways on preserving marine life. So why not create a community of people with the same interest? Though there are other volunteer clean up groups I wanted to focus on two specific areas of where I have seen the most pollution. Thank you for visiting this site and hopefully wanting to join me in saving Myrtle Beach! </p>
