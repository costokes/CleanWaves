    <h1>Marine Life</h1>
    <p>
        Marine life is essential to the ecosystem and by reducing pollution, marine life can be preserved. The most visible impacts of ocean pollution consist of plastic debris and colored water pollution.

    <h2>Tourism makes thing worse...</h2>
    <p2>
        Myrtle Beach strethces to around 60 miles of coastline and it is difficult to keep the beaches clean for marine life with that much space being polluted, especially during the summer. In 2021, 52 tons of trash was removed from Myrtle Beach after Fourth of July. Waste left behind from tourists can harm and even kill fish, dolphins, sea turtles and many other aquatic animals.
